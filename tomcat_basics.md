#1. Introduction to Tomcat
Purpose: Tomcat is used to deploy and serve Java web applications.
Components: Includes Catalina (servlet container), Coyote (HTTP connector), and Jasper (JSP engine).

#2. Installation
Download: Get the latest version from the official website.
Installation:
Windows: Extract the downloaded zip file.
Linux: Extract the tar.gz file using tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-<version>.tar.gz.

#3. Basic Configuration
Environment Variables:
Set JAVA_HOME to your JDK installation directory.
Set CATALINA_HOME to your Tomcat installation directory.
Configuration Files: Main configuration files are in the conf directory:
server.xml: Primary configuration file.
web.xml: Default servlet and JSP settings.
context.xml: Web application configuration.

#4. Starting and Stopping Tomcat
Windows: Use startup.bat and shutdown.bat scripts in the bin directory.
Linux: Use startup.sh and shutdown.sh scripts in the bin directory.

#5. Deploying Applications
WAR Files: Deploy applications by placing WAR files in the webapps directory.
Manual Deployment: Use the Tomcat Manager to deploy applications via the web interface.

#6. Tomcat Manager
Access: http://localhost:8080/manager/html.
Management: Deploy, undeploy, start, and stop applications. Monitor server status.

#7. Securing Tomcat
Change Default Passwords: Modify the tomcat-users.xml file to secure the manager and host-manager applications.
Disable Unused Connectors: Comment out unused connectors in server.xml.
TLS/SSL Configuration: Configure SSL/TLS by editing the server.xml file.

#8. Performance Tuning
JVM Settings: Adjust heap size and garbage collection settings in setenv.sh or setenv.bat.
Thread Pool: Configure the thread pool in server.xml.
Connection Pooling: Use a connection pool for database connections.

#9. Logging and Monitoring
Logging: Tomcat uses java.util.logging (JUL). Configure logging in logging.properties.
Monitoring: Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

#10. Troubleshooting
Logs: Check the logs directory for Catalina, localhost, and manager logs.
Common Issues: Look for port conflicts, out-of-memory errors, and permission issues.
